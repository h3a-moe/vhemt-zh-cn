**Q: Do Volunteers expect to be successful?**

**问：志愿者们期望这个运动取得成功吗？**

VHEMT Volunteers are realistic. We know we’ll never see the day there are no human beings on the planet. Ours is a long-range goal.

VHEMT 志愿者们是现实的。我们知道我们永远看不到人类从地球上消失的那天。我们的目标是长远的。

It has been suggested that there are only two chances of everyone volunteering to stop breeding: slim and none. The odds may be against preserving life on Earth, but the decision to stop reproducing is still the morally correct one. Indeed, the likelihood of our failure to avoid the massive die off which humanity is engineering is a very good reason to not sentence another of us to life. The future isn’t what it used to be.

有人认为，让所有人自愿停止繁殖的可能性只有两种：很小和没有。保护地球上的生命可能会遇到困难，但（人类）停止繁殖的决定在道义上仍然是正确的。实际上，人类拯救自己的极低可能性，正是不再将新生命带到这个世界上的绝佳理由。未来恐怕不会和想象中一样美好。

Even if our chances of succeeding were only one in a hundred, we would have to try. Giving up and allowing humanity to take its course is unconscionable. There is far too much at stake.

即使我们成功的机会只有百分之一，我们也必须尝试。放任人类自生自灭是不合情理的。这事关重大。

The Movement may be considered a success each time one more of us volunteers to breed no more. We are being the change we want to see in the world.

每多一个人不再繁衍，我们的运动就离成功近了一步。我们自己正在成为我们希望看到的改变。
