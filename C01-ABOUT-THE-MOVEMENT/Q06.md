 **Q: When and how did VHEMT start?**

**问：VHEMT 是何时、如何开始的？**

Roots of VHEMT run as deep as human history. Potential for a voluntary human extinction movement has been around for as long as humans have.

VHEMT 的根基深植于人类历史之中。人类自愿灭绝的可能性几乎贯穿了整个人类历史。

When Ice Age humans hunted animals to extinction, at least one of the sapient neanderthals among them may have reasoned beyond bewilderment. As the Fertile Crescent became a barren desert, and the Cedars of Lebanon were sacrificed for temples, someone must have thought, “this bodes ill.” When Romans fueled their empire by extracting resources from near and far, surely someone remarked, “Humanus non gratis,” or words to that effect. *Someone* had to get the idea that the planet would be better off without this busy horde.

当冰河世纪的人类灭绝了数种大型动物之时，有些聪明的尼安德特人恐怕就已经感到困惑了。当冰河世纪的人类灭绝了数种大型动物之时，有些聪明的尼安德特人恐怕就已经感到困惑了。当新月沃地变得贫瘠荒凉，黎巴嫩的雪松木被用来建造神殿，一定有人想过：“这是个坏兆头。”当罗马人用来自四面八方的资源驱动帝国的时候，也肯定有人说过“人类贪而无厌”之类的话。*有的人*最终得出结论，没有人类的地球会更好。

Someone, that is, besides the middle-eastern god, Yahweh/Jehovah/Allah. Tradition tells how, in prehistoric times, this creator-god realized his mistake in making humans and was going to flush us from the system, but in a weak moment he spared one breeding family. Oops! [(Genesis 6: 1-22)](http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html).

是的，我们说的就是那个亚伯拉罕的上帝，雅威、耶和华或是安拉。我们都知道，在远古时代这位造物主意识到创造人类是个多么可怕的错误，并决定把他们从地球上清除掉。只可惜他还是漏过了一家人... [(创世纪 6: 1-22)](http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html)

[The Story of Atrahasis](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/Atrahasi.htm), an earlier Sumerian myth recorded in Babylonian text, tells of multiple gods conspiring to rid Earth of the bothersome creatures they had molded out of clay. One sneaky god warns a human to build a boat before the flood, and the rest is our history.

巴比伦文本记载的苏美尔神话《阿特拉哈西斯的故事》中，多位神祇密谋消灭用泥土捏出的人类。有个神暗中警告人类在洪水来临之前造一艘船，剩下的就是我们的历史了。

We call The Movement VHEMT, but it’s undoubtedly been given other names throughout history. None have been recorded, as far as we know.

我们把我们的运动称作人类自愿灭绝运动 (VHEMT)，但是在历史上它肯定有过各种各样的名字，虽然它们没能流传下来。

There must be millions of people around the world who are [independently arriving](https://www.vhemt.org/indyarrivals.htm) at the same conclusion. A large portion of today’s Volunteers were vehement extinctionists before they learned of the title “VHEMT”.

在这世界上，必定已经有数百万的人 [各自得出了](https://www.vhemt.org/indyarrivals.htm) 相同的结论。我们的许多志愿者甚至在听说 VHEMT 以前就是自愿灭绝的支持者了。

The true origins of The Movement can be found in the natural abundance of love and logic within each one of us. Our in-born sense of justice guides us to make the responsible choice.

运动的真正起源，是我们每个人与生俱来的爱与逻辑。我们内心的正义感，指引我们做出负责任的选择。
