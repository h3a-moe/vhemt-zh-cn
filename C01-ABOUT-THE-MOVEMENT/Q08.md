**Q: We have children. Can we still join?**

**问：我们已经有孩子了，还能参加吗？**

Today’s children are tomorrow’s destiny. Our children have the potential for achieving the awareness needed to reverse civilization’s direction and begin restoring Earth’s biosphere. Most could use our help in realizing their full potentials.

今天的孩子将会决定我们明天的命运。如果我们善加引导，他们或许能扭转文明的方向，修复地球的生物圈。大多数人可以在我们的帮助下发挥全部潜力。

Naturally you’re welcome to join, and you won’t be alone. When people gain the VHEMT perspective, they decide to add no more to the existing human family. They don’t pressure their children to give them grandchildren and might encourage them to make a responsible choice with their fertility.

你当然可以参加，而且你也不是孤军奋战。只要愿意不再为人类增添后代，就能成为我们的一份子。还可以不再强迫自己的孩子去生育，而是鼓励他们作出更负责的选择。

There is no reason to feel guilty about the past. Guilt doesn’t lead to positive solutions. Being VHEMT has little to do with the past. It’s the future of life on Earth that Volunteers want to preserve. 

没必要为你的过去感到内疚。负罪感并不能解决问题。我们要拯救的，是地球生命的未来。
