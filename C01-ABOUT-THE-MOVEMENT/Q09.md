Q: Are some people opposed to VHEMT?

Q: 有人反对VHEMT吗？

At first glance, some people assume that VHEMT Volunteers and Supporters must hate people and that we want everyone to commit suicide or become victims of mass murder. It’s easy to forget that another way to bring about a reduction in our numbers is to simply stop making more of us. Making babies seems to be a blind spot in our outlooks on life.

在第一印象中，一些人认为，VHEMT的志愿者和支持者必定憎恨人类，认为我们希望每个人都去自杀或者死于屠杀。然而很容易忘记的是，只要不再生育，人类的数量就会减少。生育似乎是我们生活前景的盲区。

The idea of all of us voluntarily refraining from procreation is often dismissed without much consideration. These examples are considered elsewhere at this site:

人们不甚思考就否定我们自愿拒绝生育的想法。这些例子已经在本站其他位置提及：

“People are going to have sex, you can’t stop that.”
“It’s a human instinct to breed.”
“But I just love babies.”
“Some of us should reproduce because we’re better than others.”
“Humans are a part of Nature.”
And so on.

-“人们总是要做爱的，你阻止不了。”
-“生育是人类的本能。”
-“我就是喜欢小孩。”
-“我们有些人应当繁衍，因为我们比其他人更优秀。”
-“人类是自然的一部分。”
等等。

However, if any of us thinks about the situation long enough, and makes the effort to work through those socially-instilled blocks to clear thinking, we will arrive at virtually the same conclusion: we should voluntarily phase ourselves out for the good of humanity and planet.

然而，如果我们可以想得足够长远，努力跳出社会灌输的框架而独立思考，我们其实都会得出相同的结论：为了人类和地球的美好，我们应当自愿消亡。

VHEMT is naturally in opposition to involuntary extinction of any species, as well as any efforts encouraging human extermination. There are presently concerted efforts supporting both of these horrors. For example:

VHEMT当然反对任何物种非自愿的灭绝，也反对任何鼓励任何人类互相灭绝的努力。有一些支持这两项的恐怖行动，例如：

Production and use of weapons.
Toxin production, such as petrochemical and nuclear.
Exploitation of natural and human resources.
Promotion of reproductive fascism.
And so on.

-生产和使用武器。
-产生毒害的产业，例如石油化工和核工业。
-对自然资源和人力资源的剥削。
-鼓吹生殖法西斯主义。
等等。

The above could be called the Terrorist Human Extermination Movement (THEM), but that’s labeling and encourages a “Them or Us” attitude.

以上可以称作“恐怖主义人类灭绝运动”（THEM），但是这是划分标签和鼓励“敌我分明”的态度。

VHEMT is opposed to what these people are doing, but it’s doubtful any would bother to return the favor. Really, there isn’t much point in opposing a voluntary movement which harms none and benefits all.

VHEMT反对他们的行动，但是有没有人反对我们的行动值得怀疑。实际上，也没有太多理由反对一项百利无害的自愿的运动。

I think voluntary human extinction is misguided or worse.

我认为自愿人类灭绝存在误导或错误。

Opposition to human extinction, reproductive freedom, improved human population density, and Earth-centered thinking
