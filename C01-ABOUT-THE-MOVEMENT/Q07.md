**Q: Who is the founder?**

**问：谁是运动的创建者？**

No one person is the founder of VHEMT. [Les U. Knight](https://www.vhemt.org/les.htm) gave the name “Voluntary Human Extinction Movement” to a philosophy or worldview which has existed for as long as humans have been sapient. It’s an awareness which has been arrived at independently in many places throughout history, but had become lost amid societies’ natalism.

没有人“创建”了这个运动。 [Les U. Knight](https://www.vhemt.org/les.htm) 为这种业已存在的思潮取了名字。其实，这种思想在人类历史上的许多地方都曾独立出现过，但却在社会的本位主义中消失了。

Like millions of other people, Les followed a simple train of logic, guided by love, and arrived at the conclusion that [Gaia](https://www.vhemt.org/gaia.htm) would be better off without humans. He could be considered the finder, having identified The Movement by giving it a name, though each of us finds the truth for ourselves.

如同千百万人一样，Les 凭借着爱和理性，得出结论：[地球母亲](https://www.vhemt.org/gaia.htm)没有我们会更好。他仅仅是给运动起了个名字，而发现真相的是我们每个人的内心。

Although Les has become known internationally as a spokesperson for The Movement, no one can speak for all VHEMT Volunteers. There is no official position on issues beyond what is implied in the name of The Movement.

尽管莱斯作为 VHEMT 运动的发言人已享誉全球，但没有人能够代表所有 VHEMT 志愿者。VHEMT 运动除了自身名称表示的意思外，在其他问题上没有官方立场。
