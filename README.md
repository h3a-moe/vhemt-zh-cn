# VHEMT-zh_CN

This Repository is used to store the translation drafts of VHEMT. 

The current Chinese localization provider left a lot of content untouched, and we are intended to pick it up. 

***The prospect of VHEMT sounds too promising to believe, but I still want to introduce this, as a possible solution.***

If you are willing to help, please contact us.
