*“When the facts are incontrovertible and the conclusions inescapable; when success could bring a vast improvement in the welfare and happiness of millions; and when the penalty of failure is global disaster: surely humanity will want to collaborate and make sure that sanity prevails. ...maybe it is time that instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population, we should control the population to ensure the survival of the environment.”* Sir David Attenborough [Letter to Professor Guillebaud](http://www.ecotimecapsule.com/attenborough.html)

“当事实无可辩驳，结论不可避免；当成功可以极大地改善数百万人的福祉；当失败的代价是全球灾难时：无疑人类将希望合作，确保理智胜出。也许是时候了，与其为了人口的利益而控制环境，不如控制人口以确保环境的生存。”
