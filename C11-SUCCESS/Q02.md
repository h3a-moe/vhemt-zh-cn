**Q: Will human extinction solve all of Earth’s problems?**

**问：人类灭绝能解决地球上的所有问题吗？**

Sounds like paradise, doesn’t it? Gaia completely cured of pox humanus. Without us meddlesome humans, all other species would get their fair chance at survival.

听起来像天堂，不是吗？地球完全摆脱了人类的困扰。没有我们人类的干扰，所有其他物种都将有机会生存。

Naturally, it’s not that simple, but just for fun, let’s envision an impossible dream: all human sperm suddenly and permanently loses viability—no impregnated human egg begins meiosis to form a zygote—none transforms from embryo into the sacred fetus, is carried to term and sentenced to life. Zero conceptions, wanted nor un.

当然，事情并不是那么简单，但仅仅为了好玩，让我们设想一个不可能的梦想：所有人类的精子突然而永久地失去了活力————没有受孕的人类卵子进行减数分裂形成合子————没有一个从胚胎变成神圣的胎儿，被带到孕期并被赐予生命。零受孕，想要也没有。

A wonderful fantasy. Phones in crisis pregnancy centers would fall mysteriously silent. Sperm banks would go bankrupt after fraudulently milking the infertile. Adoption agencies would fruitlessly increase baby bounties, and charge an arm and a leg for whoever’s in stock, damaged or not. Needless panic would be hilarious. Like people frantically searching for their oars after the boat has beached.

这是一个美妙的幻想。危机妊娠中心的电话将神秘地陷入沉默。精子库会因为欺诈地挤取不育人的精子而破产。领养机构会徒劳地增加婴儿赏金，并为无论是有缺陷还是没有缺陷的婴儿收取高额费用。不必要的恐慌会令人发笑，就像人们在船搁浅后拼命寻找桨一样。

Benefits would begin immediately for both biosphere and humanity. Resources wasted on redundant breeding could be redirected to existing members of the human family in need. Loving care and nurturing now expended raising superfluous heirs could be given over to stopping the killing and beginning the healing. A sweet dream. 

生物圈和人类都将立即受益。浪费在多余繁殖上的资源可以转用于人类大家庭中需要帮助的现有成员。现在用于培养多余继承人的爱与关怀，可以用于停止杀戮和开始治疗。这是一个美好的梦想。

However, an alternative birthless future is also possible. One where people see no need to preserve Earth’s biosphere since none of our kind will be around to enjoy cartoons of it. Nature’s destruction could just as easily continue unabated as we pass into extinction. It doesn’t take billions of humans to destroy massive ecosystems, as shown by the exploits of empires from ancient times through the present.

然而，另一种无生育的未来也是可能的。在这个未来里，人们认为没有必要保护地球的生物圈，因为不会有人欣赏它的复原。随着我们的灭绝，大自然的破坏可能会有增无减。正如从古至今的帝国扩张所证明的那样，不需数十亿人类之多，就足以破坏庞大的生态系统。

No, human extinction alone won’t stop destruction of Earth’s biosphere. Our collective consciousness must evolve from anthrocentric to ecocentric: to where Earth has first priority. Then, finally, our efforts will shift from desperate, often futile, damage control to a hopeful restoration of natural balance in Earth’s ecosystems.

不，仅仅人类的灭绝不足以阻止地球生物圈的破坏。我们的集体意识必须从“以人类为中心”发展到“以生态为中心”：地球必须优先考虑。然后，最终，我们的努力将从绝望的、常常无济于事的损害控制，转变为充满希望地恢复地球生态系统的自然平衡。
