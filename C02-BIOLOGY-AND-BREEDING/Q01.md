**Q: What’s wrong with babies? Don’t you like babies?**

**问：小孩怎么你了？你们不喜欢小孩吗？**

VHEMT Volunteers love babies as much as anyone else. “Having babies” is not so much the problem—having adults is what’s causing the problems. The environmental impact of disposable diapers is heavy, but we are adults much longer than we are children.

VHEMT 志愿者和其他人一样喜欢小孩。生孩子并不是问题所在，问题的根源在于成年人。一次性尿布对环境的影响是巨大的，但我们成人对环境的污染比儿童要多得多。

People who envision having a baby often forget that they are creating an entirely new human being who will leave in a few years as an adult.

憧憬生孩子的人往往忘记了，他们创造的新生命在几年之后就会长大。

Youth is a wonderful phase of life, whether it’s people, panda, or panther. It’s sad to imagine there being no more of any of them. A baby condor may not be as cute as a baby human, but we must choose to forgo one if the others are to survive.

无论是对人、熊猫还是豹子，青春都是人生的美好阶段。失去它们实在是一件令人伤感的事。雏鹰可能不如人类幼崽可爱，但如果其他物种要生存，我们就必须选择放弃一些东西。

Children’s welfare will improve as there are fewer of them to care for. Considering the future world we are creating for future generations, procreation today is like renting rooms in a burning building—renting them to our children no less.

随着儿童的数量减少，他们的福利将得到改善。考虑到我们正在为子孙后代创造的未来，今天的生育就像是在燃烧的大楼里租房，而且是租给我们的孩子。

Choosing to refrain from producing another person demonstrates a profound love for all life.

选择不生育，体现了我们对所有生命的深爱。
